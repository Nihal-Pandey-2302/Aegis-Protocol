# üõ°Ô∏è Aegis Protocol V3: The Autonomous Sentinel

**Aegis is a fully autonomous, on-chain insurance protocol that proactively monitors digital assets. It uses a powerful synergy of Chainlink Automation and Chainlink Functions to automatically detect loss events and prepare policies for claims without requiring any user intervention.**

### **The Aegis Vision: Autonomous On-Chain Risk Management**

Aegis solves the core problem of static, manual insurance by creating a protocol that **proactively monitors assets and automatically detects loss events.** The system uses **Chainlink Automation** as its "heartbeat" and **Chainlink Functions** as its "sentinel" to create a truly trustless risk management primitive.

<summary><strong>Our Journey: From dApp to Autonomous Protocol (The Story Behind the Code)</strong></summary>

Building a truly autonomous protocol required us to solve some of the deepest challenges in Web3.

1.  **The Core Conceptual Challenge: Automating Loss Detection**
    *   **Our Solution:** We architected the Autonomous Sentinel. We integrated Chainlink Automation to act as a heartbeat, periodically triggering a Chainlink Function. This Function acts as a sentinel, using an off-chain RPC to verify asset ownership directly on the blockchain.

2.  **The Final Boss: Diagnosing a "Black Box" Revert**
    *   In our final integration tests, our functions began failing with an `UNPREDICTABLE_GAS_LIMIT` error, even though our on-chain setup was perfect. After eliminating every possible on-chain cause, we diagnosed the issue as a gas-cost problem within the Chainlink DON's simulation environment.
    *   **Our Winning Pivot:** We re-architected the on-chain logic to be ultra-gas-efficient. This deep dive into gas optimization was the final step that brought the full autonomous system to life.

*Overcoming these challenges transformed us from dApp developers into true protocol architects, capable of building and diagnosing complex, multi-service systems.*

## üèÅ The Future is Autonomous

Aegis Protocol shows how multiple Chainlink services can be composed to create truly autonomous, on-chain systems. The framework we've built is asset-agnostic and ready to provide a layer of automated security for the future of tokenized real estate, RWAs, and the entire on-chain economy.

*This project was built for the Chainlink Fall 2023 Hackathon.*
