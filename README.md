## üöÄ POST-SUBMISSION UPGRADE: The Autonomous Sentinel Protocol

**The version of Aegis initially submitted was a complete, functional insurance dApp. Since then, our team has continued building at high velocity and deployed AegisV3, a significant architectural evolution.**

-   **New Upgraded Contract (`AegisV3.sol`):** [View on Sepolia Etherscan - `0xd2Ce8CAb8285EA661ea2C6490f0f8467A39f9673`](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xd2Ce8CAb8285EA661ea2C6490f0f8467A39f9673)


This new system showcases a powerful synergy between Chainlink's core services and represents the future of truly decentralized, on-chain security.

## üìå About Aegis V3

Aegis introduces intelligent, autonomous insurance for the on-chain economy. It solves the core problem of static, manual insurance by creating a protocol that **proactively monitors assets and automatically detects loss events.**

The system uses **Chainlink Functions** as its "sentinel" to verify asset ownership off-chain and **Chainlink Automation** as its "heartbeat" to trigger these checks periodically. This eliminates the need for manual user reporting, prevents fraud, and creates a truly trustless risk management primitive.

<details>
<summary>üß† How the Autonomous System Works</summary>

1.  **Policy Creation:**
    -   A user requests a dynamic premium quote via our frontend.
    -   A **Chainlink Function** fetches live floor price data from the Reservoir API to calculate a fair, real-time premium.
    -   The user pays the premium and an immutable policy is created in our `AegisV3.sol` smart contract.

2.  **Autonomous Monitoring (The Sentinel):**
    -   A **Chainlink Automation** Upkeep runs on a set schedule (e.g., every 10 minutes).
    -   The Upkeep calls the `performUpkeep` function on our contract, telling it to check the next active policy.
    -   This triggers a **second Chainlink Function** request.

3.  **Off-Chain Verification:**
    -   This new Function executes our `checkOwner.js` script.
    -   The script uses a public RPC URL to call the `ownerOf()` function on the insured NFT's contract, directly verifying its current owner on the blockchain.
    -   It returns a simple boolean (`true` or `false`) to our smart contract.

4.  **Automatic Loss Detection & Payout:**
    -   If the script returns `false` (the NFT has moved), the `fulfillRequest` function in our contract automatically updates the policy's status to `FlaggedForReview`.
    -   The policyholder can now call the `claimPolicy()` function to receive their payout instantly. The "Claim" button only appears after the protocol has autonomously detected the loss.

<summary>üí∞ The Capital Pool: Guaranteeing Solvency</summary>

Aegis ensures reliable payouts with a fully-collateralized, on-chain Capital Pool. For this hackathon, the **Capital Pool for the `AegisV3` contract has been pre-seeded with initial liquidity** to guarantee that all valid claims made during the demo can be paid instantly. This simulates the backing a real-world project would secure from early investors. The pool is further supplemented by the premiums collected from every new policy created.

### Project Repositories

This project is organized into two separate repositories for a clean separation of concerns:

-**Latest V3 Contract:**[**AegisV3** on Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xd2Ce8CAb8285EA661ea2C6490f0f8467A39f9673)

-   **Backend & Protocol HQ (This Repo):** [Aegis-Protocol](https://github.com/Nihal-Pandey-2302/Aegis-Protocol)
    -   Contains the `AegisV3.sol` smart contract and the core project documentation.

-   **Frontend User Interface:** [aegis-frontend](https://github.com/Nihal-Pandey-2302/aegis-frontend)
    -   The **`main`** branch powers the stable V2 live demo.
    -   The **[`v3-upgrade` branch](https://github.com/Nihal-Pandey-2302/aegis-frontend/tree/v3-upgrade)** contains the most up-to-date code for interacting with our new `AegisV3` autonomous protocol.

<summary>‚úÖ How to Test the Aegis Protocol</summary>

To run this project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone (https://github.com/Nihal-Pandey-2302/aegis-frontend)
    cd aegis-frontend
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root and add your Alchemy API Key:
    `VITE_ALCHEMY_API_KEY=YOUR_ALCHEMY_KEY`
4. **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## How to Use the Aegis Demo

To test the Aegis Protocol, you will need a wallet funded with Sepolia ETH and at least one NFT on the Sepolia testnet.

### 1. Get Sepolia ETH

The Sepolia network requires ETH for gas fees. You can get free testnet ETH from a public faucet.

* **Recommended Faucet:**
- [Google Web3 Faucet](https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet)
- [Alchemy's Sepolia Faucet](https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/ethereum-sepolia)

### 2. Get a Testnet NFT

Once you have Sepolia ETH, you can mint a free, custom testnet NFT using the Bitbond Token Tool. This tool has a multi-step process.

- **NFT Minting Tool:** [Bitbond's Token Tool for Sepolia](https://tokentool.bitbond.com/create-nft/ethereum-sepolia)
- **NFT Minting Demo** [https://vimeo.com/1095478830?share=copy](https://vimeo.com/1095478830?share=copy)

- **Instructions:**
    1. **Create NFT Definition:** First, use the "Create NFT" page to define your NFT (e.g., give it a name like "My Test Asset"). This transaction creates the contract for your NFT collection.
    2. **Manage Metadata:** After creation, go to the "Manage" section of their tool. Here you can add a picture and other metadata to your NFT definition.
    3. **Mint the NFT:** Finally, go to the "Mint" section in the NFT minting page by clicking this link on the manage page. Select the NFT you just defined and mint it to your wallet address.
    4. **Check MetaMask:** After you approve the final minting transaction, the NFT should appear automatically in your MetaMask wallet under the "NFTs" tab. It will then be visible in the Aegis application.

## üèÅ Final Thoughts

Aegis Protocol shows how multiple Chainlink services can be composed to create truly autonomous, on-chain systems. By fusing **Chainlink Automation** with the power of **Chainlink Functions**, we have built a protocol that demonstrates the future of decentralized risk management.
