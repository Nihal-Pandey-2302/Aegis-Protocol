## üöÄ The Aegis V3 Autonomous Sentinel Protocol

This repository contains the smart contract and core logic for **AegisV3**, a significant architectural evolution of our original concept. We have transformed Aegis from a reactive dApp into a **proactive, autonomous risk-monitoring protocol** by integrating **Chainlink Automation** with **Chainlink Functions**.

The entire V3 backend system is **live and operational on the Sepolia testnet.**

### **Irrefutable On-Chain Proof:**

-   **V3 Smart Contract (`AegisV3.sol`):** [**`0x4e50...608c`** on Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x4e50f4aa92132bec49b59ac31bd360840b8a608c)

## üìå About Aegis V3

Aegis introduces intelligent, autonomous insurance for the on-chain economy. It solves the core problem of static, manual insurance by creating a protocol that **proactively monitors assets and automatically detects loss events.** The system uses **Chainlink Automation** as its "heartbeat" and **Chainlink Functions** as its "sentinel" to create a truly trustless risk management primitive.

<details>
<summary>üß† How the Autonomous System Works</summary>

1.  **Policy Creation:** A user creates an on-chain insurance policy. In our V2 demo, this is done via a dynamic quote from Chainlink Functions. For our V3 demo, we use a staging function to create policies directly.

2.  **Autonomous Monitoring (The Sentinel):** Our live **Chainlink Automation** Upkeep runs on a set schedule, calling the `performUpkeep` function on our `AegisV3` contract.

3.  **Off-Chain Verification:** This triggers a **Chainlink Function** which executes our `checkOwner.js` script. The script uses a public RPC to call the `ownerOf()` function on the insured NFT's contract, directly verifying its current owner.

4.  **Automatic Loss Detection:** If the script returns `false` (the NFT has moved), the `fulfillRequest` function in our contract automatically updates the policy's on-chain status to `FlaggedForReview`.

*This entire process is live and can be verified using the on-chain links provided above.*

## üèÅ Final Thoughts

Aegis Protocol shows how multiple Chainlink services can be composed to create truly autonomous, on-chain systems. By fusing **Chainlink Automation** with the power of **Chainlink Functions**, we have built a protocol that demonstrates the future of decentralized risk management.
